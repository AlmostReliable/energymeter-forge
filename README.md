## **‚öô More Information**
For more information about the usage, the functionality and the provided integrations of the mod, please
visit our [wiki].


## **üìï History**
The inspiration to create this mod came from the awesome [Energy Meters] mod in Minecraft 1.12.2.<br>
It was never updated, and we always liked a proper way to measure our energy usages.

Energy Meter is a complete rewrite and also has different features. It's not really comparable to the original mod anymore and just follows the same idea.


## **üìë Credits**
Since this is no official update nor a port of the mod, it's pretty much a standalone thing.<br>
But I want to give credit to the original author [@vladmarica] for this cool idea.


## **‚è∞ Changelog**
Everything related to versions and their release notes can be found in the [changelog].
